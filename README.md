Left to right:
* first 42 bits: amount of ms since epoch (start of 2015), retrieval: `(value >> 22) + 1420070400000`
* next 5 bits: region id(defined during compile time), retrieval: `(value & 0x3E0000) >> 17`
* next 5 bits: worker id(defined during compile time), retrieval: `(value & 0x1F000) >> 12`
* last 12 bits: For every ID that is generated on that process, this number is incremented, retrieval: `value & 0xFFF`
